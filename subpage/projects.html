        Blender: Furness Railway K2 "Larger Seagull"
    </h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 50%; font-size: 25px; margin-right: 100px; text-indent: 30px;">During the summer of 2016, I had seen numerous people of the train community create digital working models of locomotives and running them on a simulator called Railworks. Seeing how sucessful they all were, I decided, "how hard could it be?" I downloaded the animating and 3D modeling program known as Blender and made myself a Furness Railway locomotive. However, before I was able to texture it and make the final agreements with the website I was publishing to, the file was lost and all that was left was a screenshot.</p>
